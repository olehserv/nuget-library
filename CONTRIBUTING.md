## 🔂 Development Workflow

### 1. Development happens in `dev`

- **All regular development Pull Requests must target the `main` branch**
- Feature work, fixes, refactoring, and documentation updates should be merged directly into `main`
- Typical branch examples:
  - `feature/add-authentication`
  - `fix/null-reference`
  - `chore/update-ci`
  - `docs/update-readme`

---

### 2. Release process

Once PR merged into `main` a new tag is automatically created depending on commit prefix.
After that a new changes are packing to be ready to push on Nuget Server.
Push only can be done manually with GitHub Action {!specify link to it!}.
